# primes

Arbitrary precision command-line utility that generates the first N primes
greater than X written in C using GMP. The utility was designed to allow the use
of GÃ¶delization in problem solving.

The generation of prime numbers is probabilistic, and uses the Miller-Rabin
primality test to ensure the generated numbers are prime. When verifying the
output, 50 repetitions are used as the parameter, which is the maximum the
library authors deemed "reasonable."
